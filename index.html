              This is computer science group 9 developing a Hosteler App. On the research carried out, we found that there was <b>inablity
              of the to access hostels</b>. As a team, we came up with an idea of creating a mobile app that will enable students get access to
              hostels.</p> 
			  <p>The hosteler app is a mobile application that can be used by students to locate, book hostels and make payments directly to hostel owners while maintaining all the above functionalities within  the application. This project was developed due to a growing need by students especially freshers to easily find hostels without spending too much time and money.</p>
			  <p>The vast majority of hostels around Uganda do not have an existing digital system to enable students book and settle in hostel rooms, as a result many students have to waste a lot time and money looking for a hostel of their choice.
Many are usually conned by wrong elements posing as brokers hence losing even more money.
This app was developed to enable students chose from a catalogue of hostels in the application and book one of their choice. Furthermore, an inbuilt payment system makes it convenient for the student to simply pay via mobile money or visa directly on to the hostel ownerâ€™s account.
</p>
			  <p>Another challenge is many hostel owners end up with empty rooms throughout the semester just because students are not aware of the existence of their rooms. This app provides them with a platform to list their hostels where students can choose rooms that suit their needs and budget.</p>
			  <p>The application also includes a text narrator which can be used by the visually impaired to still access the services. This service can even be utilized by other students who may find it tedious to keep  reading on the screen all the time yet the app can simply tell him/her whatever information he/she needs.</p>
			  
			  <p>There were many associated problems that came a long with manual hostel search.</p>
        
            
            <h2>Some Problems associated with manual hostel search</h2>
            <li>Students waste a lot of time and money looking for Hostels.</li> 
              <li>At the same time, hostel owners spend a lot of resources like time and money in finding occupants for their hostels.</li> 
            <li>Some students get robbed by brokers who try to link them to hostels and rentals, others charge them a lot of money</li>
            <p>After the analysis carried, we came up with the solutions to eliminate and swipe off the problems students face. These problems
              are mainly faced by new students (<b>Freshers</b>) and also <b>Visually Impaired students</b>
            </p> 
            <h2>Some possible solutions</h2>
            <li>Hosteler is a platform where Hostel owners can upload information about the available rooms in their hostel and location </li>
            <li>Students can find hostel rooms that fit within their interests, budget. </li>
            <li>Students can Request/organize a physical hostel visit, in the event that the hostel has available space/rooms. </li>
            <li>Students can pay for the hostel via using Hosteler App. </li>
            <li>Hostel Owners can receive hostel fees via Hostel App direct to their Mobile Account.</li>
            <li>Hosteler App will also cater for the visually impaired students by adding a feature that will give them direction in an audio form.</li>
             
            <h2>Project goals</h2>
			<p>The following are the project goals;</p>
			<li>This project aims to build a free user friendly mobile based application to help students locate and book hostels</li>
			<li>This project aims to enable the visually impaired users utilize the app</li>
			<li>This project aims to reduce the high cases of students being conned while looking for hostels.</li>
			<li>This project aims to make it easier for hostel owners to get clients I.e., students.</li>
			<li>This project aims to help students safely make payments to hostel owners while keeping proof of payment hence helps solve issues of accountability</li>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
			<p>The application cannot work without an internet connection. This can be countered by adding an offline mode in the app where all information is downloaded on the device every time a user connects to the internet, which can then be accessed when offline.</p>
			<p>The application is only available in English. This can be solved by adding language option to include common local languages such as Luganda.</p>
			<p>This App may not cater for computer illiterate.This can be solved by offering free training and sensitization.</p>
			
			<h2>Next steps</h2>
			<p>Rebrand and expand the application to include real estate.</p>
			<p>Include a payment feature in order for the user to access and use the app, this will be through a monthly subscription</p>
			<p>Host the application on google play store and apple store</p>
